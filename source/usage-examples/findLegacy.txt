Find Multiple Documents Example (Legacy API)
============================================

.. admonition:: This is a Legacy API example
   :class: warning

   If you are not using the Legacy API, use
   :doc:`this example instead </usage-examples/find>`.

The following snippet finds and prints all documents that match a query on
the ``movies`` collection. It uses the following objects and methods:

- A **query filter** that is passed in the ``find()`` method. The ``$lt``
  operator matches only movies with a runtime of less than 15 minutes.

- A **sort** that organizes returned documents in descending order by
  title ("Z" before "A").

- A **projection** that includes the objects in the ``title`` and ``imdb``
  fields and excludes the ``_id`` field using the helper method
  ``excludeId()``.
