====================
Example (Legacy API)
====================

The following snippet finds a single document from the ``movies`` collection.
It uses the following objects and methods:

- A **query filter** that is passed in the ``find()`` method. The ``eq``
  filter matches only movies with the title exactly matching the text
  ``'The Room'``.

- A **sort** that organizes matched documents in descending order by
  rating, so if our query matches multiple documents the returned
  document is the one with the highest rating.

- A **projection** that includes the objects in the ``title`` and ``imdb``
  fields and excludes the ``_id`` field using the helper method 
  ``excludeId()``.
