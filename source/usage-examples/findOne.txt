Find a Document
===============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can retrieve a single document in a collection by chaining together
the ``find()`` and ``first()`` methods on a ``MongoCollection`` object.
You can pass a query filter to the ``find()`` method to query for and
return documents that match the filter in the collection. If you do not
include a filter, MongoDB returns all the documents in the collection. The
``first()`` method returns the first document from the matches.

For more information on querying MongoDB with the Java driver, see our
guide (**TODO: link to page **) on querying documents.

You can also chain other methods to the ``find()`` method
such as ``sort()`` (**TODO: link to CRUD Read Operations > Sort page**) which
organizes the matched documents in a specified order, and ``projection``
(**TODO: link to CRUD Read Operations > Projection page**) which configures the
included fields in the return document.

The ``find()`` returns a ``FindIterable`` iterator instance. Iterators are
helpers that allow you to traverse and retrieve a group of results. The
``first()`` method returns the first item of the iterator or ``null`` if there
are no results.

For a complete list of methods you can call on ``FindIterable`` objects,
see the
`FindIterable API documentation <http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/4.0/apidocs/mongodb-driver-sync/com/mongodb/client/FindIterable.html>`_.

Example
-------

The following snippet finds a single document from the ``movies`` collection.
It uses the following objects and methods:

- A **query filter** that is passed in the ``find()`` method. The ``eq``
  filter matches only movies with the title exactly matching the text
  ``'The Room'``.

- A **sort** that organizes matched documents in descending order by
  rating, so if our query matches multiple documents the returned
  document is the one with the highest rating.

- A **projection** that includes the objects in the ``title`` and ``imdb``
 fields and excludes the ``_id`` field using the helper method ``excludeId()``.
