This guide shows you how to create an application that uses the **Java driver**
to connect to a **MongoDB Atlas cluster**. If you prefer to connect to MongoDB
using a different driver or programming language, see our
:driver:`list of official MongoDB drivers <>`.

The Java driver lets you connect to and communicate with MongoDB instances
from a Java application.

MongoDB Atlas is a fully-managed cloud database service that hosts your data
on MongoDB instances. In this guide, we show you how to get started with your
own free (no credit card required) instance.

Follow the steps below to connect your Java application with a MongoDB Atlas
instance.
