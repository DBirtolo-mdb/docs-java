Quick Start
===========

This guide shows you how to create an application that uses the
**Java driver** to connect to a **MongoDB Atlas cluster**. If you
prefer to connect to MongoDB using a different driver or programming
language, see our :driver:`list of official drivers <>`.

The Node.js driver is an interface through which you can connect to and
communicate with MongoDB instances.

MongoDB Atlas is a fully-managed cloud database service that hosts your data
on MongoDB instances. We show you how to get started with your own free (no
credit card required) instance in this guide.

Follow the steps below to connect your Java application with a MongoDB
instance.


Set up Your Project
-------------------

Install the Java Development Kit (JDK)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create the Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add MongoDB as a Dependency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a MongoDB Cluster
------------------------

Set up a Free Tier Cluster in Atlas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Connect to your Cluster
-----------------------

Installation
============

We recommend that you add the driver to your project using a dependency
management system such as Maven or Gradle.

There are two jar files available

.. note::
   If your application is compatible only with the legacy driver, see **this
   page on using the MongoDB Legacy jar**.
   >
   We recommend that you use the ``mongo-driver-sync`` jar, but if your
   application is compatible only with the legacy API, use the 
   ``mongo-driver-legacy`` jar.


MongoDB Driver Sync
-------------------

The MongoDB Driver ``mongodb-driver-sync`` is the synchronous Java driver containing only the generic ``MongoCollection`` interface that 
complies with a new cross-driver CRUD specification.  It does *not* include the legacy API (e.g. ``DBCollection``\ ).

{{% note class="important" %}}

This is a Java 9-compliant module with an Automatic-Module-Name of ``org.mongodb.driver.sync.client``.

The ``mongodb-driver-sync`` artifact is a valid OSGi bundle whose symbolic name is ``org.mongodb.driver-sync``.

{{% /note %}}

{{< install artifactId="mongodb-driver-sync" version="4.0.0-rc0" dependencies="true">}}

MongoDB Driver Legacy
---------------------

The MongoDB Legacy driver ``mongodb-driver-legacy`` is the legacy synchronous Java driver whose entry point is ``com.mongodb.MongoClient`` 
and central classes include ``com.mongodb.DB``\ , ``com.mongodb.DBCollection``\ , and ``com.mongodb.DBCursor``.

{{% note class="important" %}}

While not deprecated, we recommend that new applications depend on the ``mongodb-driver-sync`` module.
